The database is designed to store information about network hardware connections. It maintains a comprehensive record of the various devices and their connections within the network infrastructure, including switches, routers, servers, and storage devices. The database also tracks configuration details, such as IP addresses, VLAN assignments, and port mappings, to ensure accurate and up-to-date documentation of the network topology. With this information, network administrators can quickly troubleshoot connectivity issues, plan for network expansion, and optimize performance.
